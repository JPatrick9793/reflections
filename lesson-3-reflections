When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Using a remote repository seems very useful when projects require working off different computers, or when working on a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  By pulling changes manually, the user can ensure logical pulls and make sure they are at convenient times.
  For example, automatically pulling the master branch from github while working on changes locally may cause work to be lost.
