When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Using a remote repository seems very useful when projects require working off different computers, or when working on a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  By pulling changes manually, the user can ensure logical pulls and make sure they are at convenient times.
  For example, automatically pulling the master branch from github while working on changes locally may cause work to be lost.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Cloning involves creating a copy of a file/repository locally (whether from a remote source or another local source.
	Forking involves “cloning” a repo completely on GitHub. in other words, it has no affect on the local system.
	Branches are used within existing repos.
